ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP

# Check backend status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs exbabel-backend

# Restart backend
pm2 restart exbabel-backend

# Update backend
cd /home/ubuntu/realtimetranslationapp/backend
git pull
npm install
pm2 restart exbabel-backend
```

### Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to S3
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://YOUR_BUCKET/ --delete

aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id YOUR_DIST_ID \
  --paths "/*"
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Backend health
curl http://YOUR_EC2_IP/health

# Test translation
curl -X POST http://YOUR_EC2_IP/test-translation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello","sourceLang":"en","targetLang":"es"}'
```
