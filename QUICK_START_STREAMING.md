# Quick Start: Live Streaming Translation

## 🎯 What Changed?

Your app now supports **LIVE streaming translation** - perfect for conferences and speeches! Translations appear continuously as you speak, not just after you finish.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001

3. **Use the Voice Translation interface**
   - Select your languages (e.g., English → Spanish)
   - Click the microphone button
   - **Look for the 🔴 LIVE badge** - this means streaming is active!
   - Start speaking - translations appear every 2 seconds
   - Keep talking - no need to pause or stop
   - Click microphone again to stop

## ✨ New Visual Features

### 1. LIVE Badge
```
[🔴 LIVE] Streaming translation...
```
Shows when audio is actively streaming

### 2. Audio Level Bars
```
||||| (5 bars showing volume)
```
Visual feedback of your microphone input

### 3. Processing Indicator
```
🔵 Processing audio...
```
Shows at the bottom while waiting for next translation

### 4. Smooth Animations
New translations fade in smoothly from top to bottom

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Your Voice → 2-second chunks → Backend → Gemini API → Translation → Display
          └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    Repeats continuously while speaking
```

**Key Points:**
- Audio is sent every **2 seconds** while you're speaking
- Each chunk is processed **independently**
- Translations appear with **~1-3 second latency**
- No accumulation - optimized for **long sessions**

## 🎨 What You'll See

1. **Before speaking**: Empty display with "Start speaking to see translations here"
2. **Start speaking**: LIVE badge appears, audio bars show your volume
3. **After 2 seconds**: First translation appears with animation
4. **Continue speaking**: New translations appear every 2 seconds
5. **Between chunks**: "Processing audio..." indicator pulses
6. **Stop recording**: LIVE badge disappears, all translations remain

## 📊 Example Session

```
Time: 0s  - Click microphone → LIVE badge appears
Time: 0-2s - Speaking: "Hello everyone, welcome to the conference..."
Time: 2s  - Translation appears: "Hola a todos, bienvenidos a la conferencia..."
Time: 2-4s - Speaking: "Today we'll discuss the new product features..."
Time: 4s  - Translation appears: "Hoy discutiremos las nuevas características del producto..."
Time: 4-6s - Speaking: "Starting with the most important updates..."
Time: 6s  - Translation appears: "Comenzando con las actualizaciones más importantes..."
```

Each translation appears ~1-3 seconds after you say it!

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Update Frequency

**File**: `frontend/src/hooks/useAudioCapture.js`

```javascript
// Current: 2 seconds (line 65)
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(2000)

// For 1-second updates (faster):
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(1000)

// For 3-second updates (slower but more complete sentences):
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(3000)
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Conferences**: 2-3 seconds ✅ (default)
- **Conversations**: 1-2 seconds
- **Slow/deliberate speech**: 3-4 seconds

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Speakers
1. **Speak clearly** at a moderate pace
2. **Natural pauses** help - the system sends chunks every 2 seconds
3. **Complete thoughts** - try to finish sentences within 2-4 seconds
4. **Check the LIVE badge** to confirm streaming is active
5. **Watch audio bars** to ensure your mic is picking up sound

### For Audiences
1. **Check connection status** (green = connected)
2. **Allow mic permissions** when prompted
3. **Use headphones** to avoid feedback
4. **Stable internet** for best results

## 🆚 Streaming vs Non-Streaming

| Feature | Old (Non-Streaming) | New (Streaming) ✅ |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| When translation appears | After you stop | Every 2 seconds |
| Best for | Short phrases | Long speeches |
| LIVE indicator | No | Yes |
| Processing indicator | No | Yes |
| Latency | 0s (but must stop) | 1-3s (continuous) |
| Use case | Quick translations | Conferences |

## 📱 Compatibility

**Works on:**
- ✅ Chrome 80+
- ✅ Edge 80+
- ✅ Firefox 75+
- ✅ Safari 13+

**Requires:**
- Microphone access
- Modern browser
- Stable internet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No audio detected"
- Check browser mic permissions
- Try a different browser
- Test your microphone in system settings

### "Translations are delayed"
- Check internet connection
- Reduce chunk interval to 1 second
- View backend logs for API latency

### "Too many translation boxes"
- This is normal! Each 2-second chunk creates a new entry
- Use the download button to get a clean transcript

### "LIVE badge doesn't appear"
- Check that you clicked the microphone button
- Look for connection status (should be green)
- Check browser console for errors
