# Language Testing Guide

## What Was Fixed

### Backend Changes
1. **Added Language Code Mapping**: Maps language codes (en, es, fr, etc.) to full names (English, Spanish, French, etc.)
2. **Session Language Storage**: Each WebSocket session now stores the current source and target language preferences
3. **Updated Translation Prompts**: Uses full language names in prompts to Gemini for better accuracy
4. **Improved System Instructions**: Enhanced instructions for better translation quality across all languages

### Frontend Changes
1. **Language Info in Messages**: All text and audio messages now include `sourceLang` and `targetLang` parameters
2. **Updated DemoPage**: Text translation demo now sends language information with each request
3. **Updated TranslationInterface**: Audio translation now sends language information with each recording

2. Select source language (e.g., English)
3. Select target language (e.g., French)
4. Enter text: "Hello, how are you today?"
5. Click "Translate"
6. Expected result: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui ?"

### Test Voice Translation (TranslationInterface)

3. Select target language (e.g., English)
4. Click the microphone button
5. Speak: "Hola, me llamo Juan"
6. Expected result: "Hello, my name is Juan"

### Test Language Switching
1. Start with English → Spanish
2. Translate: "Good morning" → Should get "Buenos días"
3. Switch to English → French
4. Translate: "Good morning" → Should get "Bonjour"
5. Switch to French → English
6. Translate: "Bonjour" → Should get "Hello" or "Good morning"

### Test Complex Languages
1. **Japanese**: Test with hiragana, katakana, and kanji
2. **Korean**: Test with Hangul characters
3. **Chinese**: Test with both simple and complex phrases
4. **Russian**: Test with Cyrillic characters

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Translation seems stuck in one language
**Solution**: Check the browser console for logs showing the language being sent. Refresh the page to reset the WebSocket connection.

### Issue: Translation quality is poor for certain languages
**Solution**: 
- Try being more specific in your input
- Ensure you've selected the correct source language
- Some languages work better with full sentences rather than single words

### Issue: Language doesn't change when I toggle it
**Solution**: The language should update immediately. Check the backend logs to confirm the new language preferences are being received.

## Backend Logging

When testing, check the backend console for these log messages:
- `[Backend] Language preferences updated: English → Spanish`
- `[Backend] Translating text: French → German`
- `[Backend] Translating audio: Japanese → English`

These confirm that language settings are being properly received and used.
