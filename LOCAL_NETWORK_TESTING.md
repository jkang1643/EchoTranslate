# üåê Local Network Testing Guide

Test the multi-user feature using multiple devices on your local network!

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- All devices on the same WiFi network
- Backend and frontend running on one device (host machine)
- Other devices to test with (phones, tablets, other computers)

---

## üîß Setup Steps

### Step 1: Find Your Local IP Address

**On Windows:**
```powershell
# PowerShell or Command Prompt
ipconfig

# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Terminal
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show

# Look for inet address (not 127.0.0.1)
# Example: 192.168.1.100
```

**Quick way (from WSL):**
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

Let's say your IP is: **192.168.1.100**

---

### Step 2: Configure Backend to Listen on All Interfaces

The backend should already work, but verify in `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

const server = app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`[Backend] Server running on port ${port}`);
  console.log(`[Backend] Local: http://localhost:${port}`);
  console.log(`[Backend] Network: http://YOUR_IP:${port}`);
});
```

If `0.0.0.0` isn't specified, the server only listens on localhost.

---

### Step 3: Configure Frontend for Local IP

Create or update `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3001
VITE_WS_URL=ws://192.168.1.100:3001
```

**Replace `192.168.1.100` with your actual IP address!**

---

### Step 4: Update Vite to Listen on All Interfaces

Update `frontend/vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',  // Add this line
    port: 5173
  }
})
```

---

### Step 5: Start the App

```bash
# From project root
npm start

# The frontend will now show:
# Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173
```

---

## üì± Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Laptop as Host, Phone as Listener

**On Laptop (Host Machine):**
1. Open browser: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`
2. Click "Host Mode"
3. Note the session code (e.g., "ABC123")
4. Click "Start Broadcasting"
5. Speak into laptop microphone

**On Phone (Listener):**
1. Open browser: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`
2. Scan QR code OR enter session code
3. Select your language
4. Watch translations appear!

### Scenario 2: Multiple Listeners

**Host Device:**
- Run host mode as above

**Listener Device 1:**
- Join with Spanish

**Listener Device 2:**
- Join with French

**Listener Device 3:**
- Join with German

All receive translations simultaneously!

## üî• Firewall Configuration

If devices can't connect, you may need to allow the ports through your firewall:

### Windows Firewall

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
# Allow port 3001 (backend)
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Translation Backend" -Direction Inbound -Port 3001 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow

# Allow port 5173 (frontend)
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Translation Frontend" -Direction Inbound -Port 5173 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

### macOS Firewall

System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall ‚Üí Firewall Options
- Allow Node.js and npm to accept incoming connections

### Linux (UFW)

```bash
sudo ufw allow 3001/tcp
sudo ufw allow 5173/tcp
```

---

## üì≤ QR Code for Easy Access

The QR code will automatically contain your local IP address:
```
http://192.168.1.100:5173?join=ABC123
```

Listeners can scan this QR code with their phone camera and join instantly!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"

**Check 1: Verify IP address**
```bash
ping 192.168.1.100
```

**Check 2: Test backend directly**
```bash
# From another device
curl http://192.168.1.100:3001/health
```

**Check 3: Verify firewall**
- Temporarily disable firewall to test
- If it works, add firewall rules as above

### "WebSocket connection failed"

**Check 1: Verify WebSocket URL**
- Should be `ws://192.168.1.100:3001` (not `wss://`)
- Should NOT be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

**Check 2: Mixed content**
- If you're using HTTPS anywhere, all connections must be HTTPS/WSS
- For local testing, use HTTP/WS everywhere

### "QR code scan doesn't work"

**Option 1: Manual entry**
- Just type the session code instead

**Option 2: Share link directly**
- Copy link: `http://192.168.1.100:5173?join=ABC123`
- Send via messaging app

### "Phone can't access the app"

**Check 1: Same network**
- Verify phone is on same WiFi network
- Not on cellular data

**Check 2: Network isolation**
- Some WiFi networks isolate devices (guest networks, public WiFi)
- Try on home network

**Check 3: VPN**
- Disable VPN on testing devices
- VPN can block local network access

## üåç Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Use a domain name** instead of IP
2. **Enable HTTPS/WSS** for security
3. **Configure CORS** properly
4. **Use environment variables** for URLs
5. **Add authentication** for host mode
6. **Implement rate limiting**
7. **Use Redis** for session storage (scalability)
8. **Set up monitoring** and logging
