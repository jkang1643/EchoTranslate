# API Quota Error - Solution Guide

## 🚨 The Issue

**Error Code 1011: You exceeded your current quota**

Your Gemini API key has reached its usage limits. This is **not a code bug** - it's an API rate limit issue.

---

## 🔍 What's Happening

```
[Backend] Gemini Realtime connection closed. Code: 1011
Reason: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

**Why it happens:**
1. You connect to Gemini ✓
2. Setup completes ✓  
3. Gemini checks your quota → **OVER LIMIT** ❌
4. Gemini closes connection immediately
5. Auto-reconnect tries again → Same result
6. Endless reconnect loop = No translations

## ✅ Solutions (Choose One)

### **Solution 1: Wait for Quota Reset (Free)**

If you're on the **free tier**:

**Per-minute limit**: 15 requests/minute
- **Wait**: 1-2 minutes
- Quota resets automatically

**Daily limit**: 1500 requests/day  
- **Wait**: Until midnight UTC (~7-8pm EST)
- Quota resets at start of new day

**To check when reset happens:**
```bash
# Current time in UTC
date -u
```

---

### **Solution 2: Create New API Key (Free)**

Sometimes you can get more quota with a fresh key:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Copy the new key
4. Update `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...new_key_here...
   ```
5. Restart server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### **Solution 3: Use Different Google Account (Free)**

Create API key under different Google account:

1. Sign out of current Google account
2. Sign in with different account
3. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
4. Create API key
5. Use new key in `backend/.env`

---

### **Solution 4: Upgrade to Paid Plan (Recommended for Production)**

Get **much higher limits** with billing enabled:

**Free Tier:**
- 15 requests/minute
- 1500 requests/day

**Paid Tier:**
- 1500 requests/minute (100x more!)
- 1 million requests/day (666x more!)

**How to upgrade:**

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select project
3. Enable billing
4. Go to [APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
5. Enable "Generative Language API"
6. Create new API key (in Cloud Console, not AI Studio)
7. Use new key in `backend/.env`

**Cost:**
- Gemini 2.0 Flash: ~$0.075 per 1M input tokens
- Very affordable for most use cases

## 🔧 What I Fixed in the Code

### **1. Stop Reconnect Loop on Quota Errors**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Would reconnect endlessly even on quota errors
ws.on("close", async (code, reason) => {
  reconnect(); // ❌ Keeps trying even when quota exceeded
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
ws.on("close", async (code, reason) => {
  if (code === 1011) {
    // Quota error - don't reconnect
    console.error('⚠️ QUOTA EXCEEDED');
    sendErrorToClient();
    return; // ✅ Stop trying
  }
  // Only reconnect for other errors
  reconnect();
});
```

### **2. Show Quota Error in UI**

**Frontend now shows alert:**
```
⚠️ API Quota Exceeded!

You have reached your Gemini API limit. 
Please check your quota at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Please check your Gemini API limits and try again later.
```

### **3. Auto-Stop Recording**

If quota exceeded during streaming, the app:
- Shows error alert
- Automatically stops recording
- Prevents wasting more quota attempts

## 📊 Check Your Current Quota

### **Option 1: Google AI Studio**

1. Visit [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Click on your API key
3. View usage stats

### **Option 2: Google Cloud Console** 

1. Go to [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Dashboard**
3. Click **Generative Language API**
4. View **Quotas** tab

---

## 🧪 Test If Quota Is Fixed

After waiting or getting new key:

```bash
# 1. Restart server
npm run dev

# 2. Watch backend logs - should NOT show:
# ❌ "Code: 1011"
# ❌ "exceeded your current quota"

# 3. Should show:
# ✅ "Connected to Gemini Realtime"
# ✅ "Gemini setup complete"
# ✅ "Translation session ready"
```

---

## 💡 Reduce Quota Usage

To make your quota last longer:

### **1. Use Text Instead of Audio**
Text translation uses **much less quota** than audio:
- Use the "Text Demo" tab for testing
- Only use audio/voice when actually needed

### **2. Reduce Streaming Frequency**
Edit `frontend/src/hooks/useAudioCapture.js`:

```javascript
// Current: 2-second chunks
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(2000)

// Change to 5-second chunks:
mediaRecorderRef.current.start(5000) // Saves quota!
```

### **3. Test with Shorter Sessions**
- Don't leave recording running
- Click stop when not actively translating
- Test with short phrases first

### **4. Use Development Mode Wisely**
Every time you save code and hot-reload counts toward quota. Be mindful during development.
