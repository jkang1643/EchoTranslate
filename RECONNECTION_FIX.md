# Gemini Reconnection Fix

## Problem
After processing one audio chunk in streaming mode, the Gemini WebSocket connection was closing, causing the GUI to show "disconnected" and preventing subsequent translations.

## Root Cause
The Gemini Multimodal Live API closes the WebSocket connection after completing a response when `turn_complete: true` is set. This is expected behavior for single-turn conversations, but problematic for continuous streaming where we send multiple audio chunks.

## Solution
Implemented **automatic reconnection** mechanism:

### Key Changes

1. **Connection Function** (`connectToGemini()`)
   - Extracted connection logic into reusable async function
   - Handles initial setup and configuration
   - Returns Promise that resolves when connected

2. **Event Handler Attachment** (`attachGeminiHandlers()`)
   - Centralized all Gemini WebSocket event handlers
   - Handles: `message`, `error`, and `close` events
   - Reusable for both initial connection and reconnections

3. **Automatic Reconnection Logic**
   - When Gemini closes the connection, automatically reconnect
   - 500ms delay before reconnection attempt
   - Reattaches all event handlers to new connection
   - Notifies client of reconnection status
   - Prevents multiple simultaneous reconnection attempts

4. **Better Logging**
   - Logs close codes and reasons
   - Tracks reconnection attempts
   - Shows session IDs for debugging

### How It Works

```
Client sends audio chunk
    ↓
Backend → Gemini (processes and responds)
    ↓
Gemini closes connection (expected behavior)
    ↓
Backend detects close event
    ↓
Wait 500ms
    ↓
Backend reconnects to Gemini
    ↓
Reattaches event handlers
    ↓
Sends "session_ready" to client
    ↓
Ready for next audio chunk
```

### Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience** - User doesn't notice disconnections
2. **Continuous Streaming** - Can send unlimited audio chunks
3. **Resilient** - Handles temporary connection issues
4. **Clear Logging** - Easy to debug if issues occur
5. **No Client Changes** - Frontend continues to work as-is

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
1. Click microphone → LIVE badge appears
2. Speak for 2 seconds → First translation appears
3. Speak for 2 more seconds → Connection closed, no translation
4. GUI shows "disconnected"
```

### After Fix:
```
1. Click microphone → LIVE badge appears
2. Speak for 2 seconds → First translation appears
3. [Backend auto-reconnects in background]
4. Speak for 2 more seconds → Second translation appears
5. [Backend auto-reconnects again]
6. Continue speaking → Translations keep appearing
7. GUI stays connected throughout
```

## Backend Console Output

### Successful Streaming Session:
```
[Backend] New WebSocket client connected
[Backend] Connecting to Gemini Multimodal Live API...
[Backend] Connected to Gemini Realtime
[Backend] Sent setup configuration to Gemini
[Backend] Gemini setup complete
[Backend] Streaming audio chunk: English → Spanish
[Backend] Gemini response: {"serverContent":{"modelTurn":...
[Backend] Gemini Realtime connection closed. Code: 1000, Reason: 
[Backend] Attempting to reconnect to Gemini...
[Backend] Connecting to Gemini Multimodal Live API...
[Backend] Connected to Gemini Realtime
[Backend] Sent setup configuration to Gemini
[Backend] Successfully reconnected to Gemini
[Backend] Streaming audio chunk: English → Spanish
[Backend] Gemini response: {"serverContent":{"modelTurn":...
[Backend] Gemini Realtime connection closed. Code: 1000, Reason:
[Backend] Attempting to reconnect to Gemini...
```

### Error Handling:
If reconnection fails:
```
[Backend] Failed to reconnect to Gemini: [error details]
```
Client receives:
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "Failed to reconnect to translation service"
}
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Audio Message Format**
   - Changed order: text instruction first, then audio
   - More reliable for Gemini to understand context

2. **Connection State Tracking**
   - `reconnecting` flag prevents multiple simultaneous reconnections
   - Safer handling of race conditions

3. **Client Notification**
   - Client receives `session_ready` message after reconnection
   - Allows frontend to show reconnection status if desired

## Configuration

### Reconnection Delay
Current: 500ms (line 150 in server.js)

To adjust:
```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Change 500 to desired ms
```

**Recommendations:**
- 500ms - Good balance (default)
- 250ms - Faster, but may hit rate limits
- 1000ms - Slower, more conservative

## Known Behavior

- **Close Code 1000**: Normal closure - expected after each translation
- **Reconnection is automatic**: No user action required
- **Language preferences persist**: Maintained across reconnections
- **Session ID stays same**: Consistent throughout client connection

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. **Connection pooling**: Maintain multiple Gemini connections
2. **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for failed reconnections
3. **Health checks**: Proactively test connection before sending
4. **Metrics**: Track reconnection frequency and success rate

## Troubleshooting

### If reconnection fails repeatedly:
1. Check API key is valid
2. Verify Gemini API quota
3. Check internet connectivity
4. Look for rate limiting errors in logs

### If translations still stop:
1. Check backend console for error messages
2. Verify close code (should be 1000 for normal)
3. Check if client WebSocket is still open
4. Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

## Summary

The fix transforms the app from **single-turn** to **continuous multi-turn** streaming by automatically reconnecting to Gemini after each translation completes. This enables true live streaming for conferences and speeches without interruption.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested
**Impact**: Zero - seamless to end users
**Performance**: Minimal overhead (~500ms between chunks)
