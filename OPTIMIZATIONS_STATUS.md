## ‚úÖ **ACTIVE OPTIMIZATIONS (6/8)**

### 1. Audio Chunking with Overlap Buffer
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Active  
**File:** `frontend/public/audio-stream-processor.js`

- **Implementation:** 300ms chunks with 500ms overlap
- **Details:**
  - Ring buffer maintains overlap between chunks (prevents dropped words at boundaries)
  - Processes on separate AudioWorklet thread (doesn't block UI)
  - Sends chunk metadata: `chunkIndex`, `startMs`, `endMs`, `sampleRate`, `overlapMs`
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents word loss at chunk boundaries
  - Reduces audio processing latency
  - Maintains smooth UI rendering

---

### 2. Sequence Numbering and Timestamps
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Active  
**Files:** 
- `backend/soloModeHandler.js` (backend)
- `frontend/src/components/TranslationInterface.jsx` (frontend)

- **Backend Implementation:**
  - `sendWithSequence()` function adds `seqId` and `serverTimestamp` to all messages
  - Tracks `sequenceCounter` and `latestSeqId` for ordering
- **Frontend Implementation:**
  - Sends `chunkIndex`, `startMs`, `endMs`, `clientTimestamp` with audio chunks
  - Uses `latestSeqIdRef` to drop stale/out-of-order messages
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents race conditions from network reordering
  - Enables accurate latency measurement
  - Improves reliability under poor network conditions

---

### 3. RTT Measurement and Adaptive Finalization
**Status:** ‚úÖ Active (tracking only, adaptive lookahead unused)  
**File:** `backend/soloModeHandler.js`

- **Implementation:**
  - `measureRTT()` function calculates round-trip time from client timestamps
  - Filters invalid RTT values (negative, >10s)
  - Maintains rolling average of last 10 RTT measurements
  - `getAdaptiveLookahead()` calculates dynamic lookahead: `RTT/2` capped at 200-700ms
- **Current Status:**
  - RTT measurement is active and logging
  - Adaptive lookahead calculation exists but not currently used
  - Constants defined: `MIN_SILENCE_MS=500ms`, `FINALIZATION_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW=300ms`
- **Benefits:**
  - Enables network-aware finalization (when active)
  - Improves accuracy in varying network conditions
  - Reduces premature finalization on slow networks

### 4. WebSocket Message Format with Sequence IDs
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Active  
**Files:** 
- `backend/soloModeHandler.js`
- `frontend/src/components/TranslationInterface.jsx`

- **Message Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "translation",
    "seqId": 123,
    "serverTimestamp": 1234567890,
    "isPartial": true,
    "originalText": "...",
    "translatedText": "...",
    "hasTranslation": true
  }
  ```
- **Frontend Filtering:**
  - Drops messages with `seqId < latestSeqIdRef.current`
  - Prevents stale partials from overwriting newer results
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents race conditions
  - Ensures message ordering
  - Improves reliability

---

### 5. Tab Visibility Change Detection
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Active  
**File:** `frontend/src/components/TranslationInterface.jsx`

- **Implementation:**
  - Listens for `document.visibilitychange` events
  - Sends `client_hidden` or `client_visible` messages to backend
  - Cleans up event listener on unmount
- **Backend Handling:**
  - Backend receives and logs visibility changes
  - Can adjust processing when tab is backgrounded
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents unnecessary processing when tab is hidden
  - Improves resource usage
  - Handles browser throttling gracefully

### 6. Separate Partial vs Final Translation Workers
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Active  
**File:** `backend/translationWorkers.js`

- **PartialTranslationWorker:**
  - Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (fast, cost-effective)
  - Temperature: `0.2` (consistent)
  - Max tokens: `500` (sufficient for partials)
  - Features:
    - Request cancellation (aborts if newer partial arrives)
    - Larger cache (200 entries, 2-minute TTL)
    - Handles incomplete sentences gracefully
- **FinalTranslationWorker:**
  - Model: `gpt-4o` (high quality)
  - Temperature: `0.3` (balanced)
  - Max tokens: `2000` (full context)
  - Features:
    - No cancellation (always completes)
    - Standard cache (100 entries, 10-minute TTL)
    - Complete sentence context
- **Usage:**
  - `partialTranslationWorker.translatePartial()` - for live updates
  - `finalTranslationWorker.translateFinal()` - for history
  - Both used in `soloModeHandler.js` and `hostModeHandler.js`
- **Benefits:**
  - Lower latency for live partials
  - Higher quality for final translations
  - Cost optimization (faster model for partials)
  - Better user experience (responsive live updates)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **SIMPLIFIED/REMOVED OPTIMIZATIONS (2/8)**

### 7. Robust STT Finalization with Silence Detection
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified to Immediate Finalization  
**File:** `backend/soloModeHandler.js`

- **Original Design:**
  - Wait for `MIN_SILENCE_MS` (500ms) silence before finalizing
  - Use adaptive lookahead based on RTT
  - Confirmation window (`FINALIZATION_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW=300ms`)
  - Cancel finalization if new audio arrives
- **Current Implementation:**
  - **Immediate finalization** when Google Speech sends a final result
  - No silence detection or confirmation window
  - Cancels any pending finalization timeouts on new partials
- **Reason for Change:**
  - Delayed finalization kept getting cancelled by new audio
  - Caused finals to never be sent to frontend
  - Simplified approach is more reliable
- **Future Consideration:**
  - RTT measurement code remains for potential future use
  - Could re-implement with smarter cancellation logic

---

### 8. Delayed History Writing with Confirmation Window
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Changed to Immediate Commit  
**File:** `frontend/src/components/TranslationInterface.jsx`

- **Original Design:**
  - Wait 200ms confirmation window before committing final to history
  - Store pending final in `pendingFinalRef`
  - Use `setTimeout` with ref-based callback
- **Current Implementation:**
  - **Immediate commit** when final message arrives
  - Uses `flushSync()` for instant UI update
  - Processes through segmenter for deduplication
- **Reason for Change:**
  - Delayed commit caused history box to never appear
  - Closure issues with timeout callbacks
  - Immediate approach is more reliable and responsive
- **Current Flow:**
  1. Final message arrives from backend
  2. Process through `sentenceSegmenter.processFinal()`
  3. Immediately add to `finalTranslations` state with `flushSync()`
  4. Clear live partial display

## üìù **NOTES**

1. **RTT Measurement:** Code is active and tracking, but adaptive finalization is currently disabled. The infrastructure is ready if we want to re-enable it with smarter logic.

2. **Delayed Finalization:** Removed due to bugs, but the constants (`MIN_SILENCE_MS`, `FINALIZATION_CONFIRMATION_WINDOW`) are still defined for potential future use.

3. **Immediate vs Delayed:** Both finalization and history commit were simplified to immediate approaches for reliability. This sacrifices some theoretical optimizations but ensures the app works correctly.

4. **Translation Workers:** This optimization is fully active and provides significant benefits:
   - Faster partials (GPT-4o-mini)
   - Higher quality finals (GPT-4o)
   - Cost savings (cheaper model for frequent partials)

## üéØ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

Potential improvements to consider:
- Re-implement adaptive finalization with smarter cancellation logic
- Add back delayed history commit with better closure handling
- Use RTT measurements for adaptive lookahead buffer sizing
- Implement WebRTC DataChannel for background tab handling
- Add phrase hints and custom vocabulary to improve exact-word matching
