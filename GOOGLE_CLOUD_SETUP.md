# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for live streaming transcription with Chirp 3.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

**Want the simple way?** Use an API key instead of JSON!

ðŸ‘‰ See **[QUICKSTART_GOOGLE_APIKEY.md](QUICKSTART_GOOGLE_APIKEY.md)** for the easiest setup (just like OpenAI)

This guide below covers the **service account JSON method** (more secure for production).

## Architecture Overview

**Exbabel now uses a dual-service architecture:**

1. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** - For live streaming transcription with partial results
   - Model: Chirp 3 (`latest_long`)
   - Features: Word-by-word interim results, high accuracy, multilingual support
   - Streaming limit: 4 minutes per stream (auto-restarts)

2. **OpenAI Chat API** - For translation of final transcripts
   - Model: `gpt-4o`
   - Translates finalized transcripts to target languages

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account
- Node.js and npm installed
- OpenAI API key (for translation)

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on the project dropdown at the top
3. Click "New Project"
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "exbabel-app")
5. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Enable the Speech-to-Text API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Library**
2. Search for "Speech-to-Text API"
3. Click on "Cloud Speech-to-Text API"
4. Click "Enable"

## Step 3: Create a Service Account

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Enter a service account name (e.g., "exbabel-speech")
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Grant the role: **"Cloud Speech Client"** or **"Cloud Speech Administrator"**
6. Click "Continue" then "Done"

## Step 4: Generate and Download Credentials

1. In the **Credentials** page, find your service account
2. Click on the service account email
3. Go to the **Keys** tab
4. Click "Add Key" > "Create New Key"
5. Choose **JSON** format
6. Click "Create"
7. The key file will download automatically - **keep this secure!**

## Step 5: Configure Your Application

### Option A: Local Development (Recommended)

1. Move the downloaded JSON key file to your backend directory:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/your-project-xxxxx.json backend/google-credentials.json
   ```

2. Create or update `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   # Transcription (Google Cloud)
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-credentials.json

   # Translation (OpenAI)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

   # Server
   PORT=3001
   ```

3. **IMPORTANT:** Add the credentials file to `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   echo "backend/google-credentials.json" >> .gitignore
   ```

### Option B: Production Deployment

For production on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

1. Use Google Cloud's default credentials (no file needed)
2. Set up Application Default Credentials:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

3. Or deploy to GCP services (Cloud Run, GKE, etc.) which automatically provide credentials

## Step 6: Install Dependencies

The `@google-cloud/speech` package has already been added to your project:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Step 7: Test Your Setup

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Look for these startup messages:
   ```
   [Backend] ===== TRANSCRIPTION SERVICE =====
   [Backend] Provider: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
   [Backend] Model: Chirp 3 (latest_long)
   [Backend] Google Cloud: Credentials configured âœ“
   ```

3. Check the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

   You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "transcriptionProvider": "Google Cloud Speech-to-Text",
     "transcriptionModel": "Chirp 3 (latest_long)",
     "translationProvider": "OpenAI",
     "translationModel": "gpt-4o"
   }
   ```

## Language Support

Google Cloud Speech-to-Text supports **100+ languages** including:

- English (en-US, en-GB, en-AU, etc.)
- Spanish (es-ES, es-MX, es-AR, etc.)
- French (fr-FR, fr-CA)
- German (de-DE)
- Japanese (ja-JP)
- Chinese (zh-CN, zh-TW)
- Korean (ko-KR)
- And many more...

See the full list: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages

## Features of the New Architecture

### Live Partial Results
- **Word-by-word streaming**: See transcription appear as you speak
- **High accuracy**: Chirp 3 model provides superior accuracy
- **Low latency**: Partial results delivered in real-time

### Automatic Stream Management
- Auto-restart before 4-minute streaming limit
- Seamless continuation across stream boundaries
- Automatic punctuation and formatting

### Translation Pipeline
1. Audio â†’ Google Speech â†’ Live partial transcript (shown immediately)
2. Speech pause detected â†’ Final transcript
3. Final transcript â†’ OpenAI â†’ Translation (to target language)
4. Translation displayed to user

## Pricing

### Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- **Standard**: $0.006 per 15 seconds (~$1.44 per hour)
- **Enhanced models**: $0.009 per 15 seconds (~$2.16 per hour)
- **First 60 minutes free per month**

See: https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/pricing

### OpenAI API
- **GPT-4o**: ~$0.005 per 1K tokens (translation only)
- Much cheaper than previous approach since only final transcripts are translated

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Could not load the default credentials"
- Make sure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to a valid JSON file
- Check that the path is correct (relative to backend directory)
- Verify the service account has "Cloud Speech Client" role

### Error: "API has not been enabled"
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Enable the "Cloud Speech-to-Text API"
- Wait a few minutes for propagation

### Error: "Quota exceeded"
- Check your Google Cloud quotas in the console
- Upgrade to a billing-enabled account for higher limits
- Monitor usage in the Google Cloud Console

### No partial results appearing
- Verify `interimResults: true` in the configuration
- Check that audio is being received (check console logs)
- Ensure frontend is handling `isPartial: true` messages

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to git**
   - Always use `.gitignore` for credential files
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Restrict service account permissions**
   - Only grant "Cloud Speech Client" role
   - Don't use owner/editor roles

3. **Rotate credentials periodically**
   - Create new keys every 90 days
   - Delete old keys after rotation

4. **Monitor API usage**
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Review usage regularly in Cloud Console

## Next Steps

- Test with different languages
- Adjust stream restart timing if needed
- Monitor costs and optimize as needed
- Consider using Google Cloud's VPC for enhanced security
